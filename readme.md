# Zeta

*finally* a human friendly robotics framework

Zeta is a robotics framework that unifies the robot development cycle. It aims to shorten the time from zero to code to minutes.

## Warning ⚠️
Zeta is still work in progress, and as such, shouldn't be used for production pipelines yet.

Zeta is designed to serve my projects' current needs. 

If you find the code in it useful, go ahead! but I am not able to guarantee it will work for everyone.

## Preamble

Traditional robot ecosystems like ROS are loosely coupled and may not work on all edge devices. 

Zeta aims to solve this issue by encouraging composable code with hermetic builds, meaning your code can run on a wide range of environments.
