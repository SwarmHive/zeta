# Zeta

*finally* a human friendly robotics framework

Zeta is a robotics framework that unifies the robot development cycle. It aims to shorten the time from zero to code to minutes.

## Warning ⚠️
Zeta is still work in progress, and as such, shouldn't be used for production pipelines yet.

## Preamble

Traditional robot ecosystems like ROS are loosely coupled and may not work on all edge devices. 

Zeta aims to solve this issue by encouraging composable code with hermetic builds, meaning your code can run on a wide range of environments.

Zeta is built on modern tooling like Bazel for hermetic builds and NATS for lightweight messaging, providing a batteries-included dev experience without additional complexity.
